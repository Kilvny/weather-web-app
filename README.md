# Weather Condition Web App
A web app to check weather condition that I designed and developed using :
-
* React
* NodeJS Express
* TailwindCSS
* WeatherAPI

How it works: 
-
*When you first open the application tab it detects your location and then send the according data as a request to the server side which then take that data and send inquiry to the WeatherAPI*

*WeatherAPI send the response back and we send the necessary data as a response back to the client side*

*Also I added a search Feild that you can check the data for any city around the globe*

*I added a weekly forecast feild but unfortunately I found that in order to get the data for more than 3 days to come I had to pay WeatherAPI so I decided to leave it as it is :)*
